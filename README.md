# 💻 T-Rex Game 

## ✏️ Project description
Our goal was to create a game similar to the T-Rex game in Google Chrome, where there is a character jumping over obstacles.

## 💻How it works?

## 👩‍💻 Development Rules
**Character Movement:**

- Allow the player to control the character's movement using keyboard input (e.g.,spacebar for jumping).
- Implement gravity to simulate realistic jumping behavior for the character.

**Obstacle Generation:**

- Generate obstacles (e.g., cacti) at regular intervals
- Ensure obstacles move towards the character at a consistent pace to create a sense of challenge.

**Collision Detection:**
- Detect collisions between the character and obstacles to determine when the game ends.
- End the game and display the final score when a collision occurs.
**Extra Steps (Optional):**
- Implement a scoring system to track the number of obstacles successfully
jumped over by the character.
- Display the current score on the game screen and update it as the player
progresses.
- Add additional features such as sound effects, background music, or visual effects to enhance the gaming experience.
- Implement randomized obstacles with varying heights and positions to increase replayability and difficulty.
